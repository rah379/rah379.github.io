  For the final project of CS 3410, we were given groups
and tasked with simulating the performance of different
cache designs.

  Our goal was to use C to simulate the behavior of 
different caches, with the goal of seeing the benefits
and downsides of the designs under different use needs. 
(i.e. large caches w/ set-associative design, etc.)

  We simulated single-core & multi-core designs, 
under both direct-mapped, and set-associative 
organization, measuring their hit rates as well as 
writebacks, snooping, and upgrade misses. 

  For academic integrity reasons I won't post the code
or statistics / graphs.
