  My name's Rowan Hennessy, and I'm currently a senior
in Cornell University's College of Arts & Sciences. I'm
pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Math, 
and am expected to graduate in May, 2025. 

  I'm originally from New Albany, Ohio, and was
indoctrinated into the cult of Ohio State Football at a
very young age. In my free time, I enjoy reading pretty
much anything. Some of my favorite books are:

    - Normal People, by Sally Rooney
    - Cloud Cuckoo Land, by Anthony Doerr
    - The Wheel of Time Series, by Robert Jordan

  I also enjoy wilderness tripping and being outside

  I'm interested in the use of mathematical and 
quantitative tools to solve realistic problems.
Specifically, financial decision making and the use 
of stochastic calculus/formal probability to model 
financial markets.
