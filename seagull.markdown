  For a project in CS 4740, we were given the task of
re-implementing "Seagull", a transformer-based language
model.

  We were given descriptions of NYT Cartoons, and 
Seagull was intended to output a humorous caption. 
To do so, we had to fine-tune the model parameters,
using tokenization of words and MHA for the 
feed-forward neural network. 

  To speed up model training time, we used NVIDIA's
CUDA Deep Neural Network for faster iterations. 

  The neural network was built using PyTorch on the
Google CoLab Cloud GPU + TPU for training speed. 

  For academic integrity reasons, I won't post the 
code or model, as I did not build the technical
architecture.
