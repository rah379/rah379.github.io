  In [A Practical Guide to Quantitative Finance 
Interviews], also known as the "Little Green Book", 
Chapter 7 is dedicated to Algorithms and Numerical
Methods. 
  The chapter consists of a series of problems, 
where the goal is to implement the most efficient
algorithm (or computation) possible to solve the 
problem. 
  Since reading a solution and actually being able
to implement it are pretty different levels of 
understanding, I decided to take the time to actually
implement all of the algorithms. 
  Eventually, I hope to examine the concrete 
runtime differences of different languages' here. 
  (I plan to make the repo public as soon as I finish
all problems in Python)
