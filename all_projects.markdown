  While not actively in school, I like to work on
projects in the subjects currently interesting me. Here
is a subset of all the projects I've done, both for 
school and out of personal interest. 

  Some projects have the GitHub repos linked, while 
others must remain private for Academic Integrity. Some
of the academic projects may be outdated due to lack of
maintenance or of server to host them on. 

  Additionally, I personally maintain this website, a 
GitHub Pages site implemented using the open-source 
Jekyll framework
