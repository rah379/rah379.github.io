  For the past three summers, I've led wilderness trips
through a YMCA camp based out of Ely, Minnesota. I
went to this camp every summer from 6th grade to after
my senior year, capping off with a 35-night trip to the
Gates of the Arctic National Park in northern Alaska. 

  That trip was a great experience for me, and I
decided to try and pass on that same experience, 
which is what I've committed to for the past three 
summers. 

  The longest trip I've led was a 24-night, 300-mile 
canoeing trip from Bending Lake in Ontario to Lake
Superior in Minnesota, finishing the famous 9-mile 
Grand Portage. 

  Other trips have included 14 nights in the Quetico
Provincial Park in Ontario, as well as 10 nights in 
the Absaroka Range in Wyoming. If you're interested
in hearing more, send me an email!
