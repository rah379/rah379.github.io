  For the final project of CS 3110, we were told to
design and implement a large project of our choice, 
in a group of up to five. 

  My group decided to implement the board game RISK
in OCaml, using a command-line based GUI.

  The project totals ~1600 LoC, with >98% of that in
OCaml. We implemented a few different maps, as well.

  Below are links to the project's repo, as well as
a demonstration of playing the game, made by one of
my project partners.
