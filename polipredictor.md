  For CS 4300, we were tasked with creating a search
engine that used ad-hoc querying and a dataset we
we found or scraped ourselves. 

  My group decided to scrape tweets from politicians, 
and match the user with politicians who have tweeted
similar political beliefs to the query. 

  We used SVD and sentiment analysis as an attempt to
match the user's sentiment, rather than an arbitrary
distance based search engine. 

  Below are links to the repo, as well as an example
query & output of the search engine (click to enlarge).
