  The NYT Spelling Bee is a little daily puzzle that
I thought had a pretty interesting generalization.

  Although I started this project looking for fast 
methods to solve any given Spelling Bee, it ended up
becoming a longer analysis of the words a human 
curator would consider "obscure" as well. 

  I began by formalizing the problem and measuring 
naive solving methods, before going back to analyze
the data. I'm currently working on solidifying the 
analysis and optimizing solving methods. 

  The PDF below is my current draft, which is
currently somewhat segmented due to incompleteness. 
The Github repo is private, due to being an incomplete
analysis.
